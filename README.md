# Time Series Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for a time series analysis project. The goal of this project is to analyze temporal patterns in the given dataset and derive meaningful insights. The time series analysis involves techniques for understanding, modeling, and forecasting time-dependent data.

## Introduction

Time series analysis is a crucial aspect of data science, where the primary focus is on understanding and extracting patterns from data points that are ordered chronologically. This project employs various time series analysis techniques to uncover trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the provided dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `code`: Contains all the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and modeling `time_series_analysis.ipynb`.
- `data`: Stores the raw and processed datasets `long_data_.csv`.
- `docs`: Documentation files, including this `README.md`.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional but recommended)

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data 

This Time Series Analysis uses the dataset provied by kaggle about POWER CONSUMPTION IN INDIA (2019 - 2020) which is in `long_data_.csv` file
